Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance,
we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.

class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self):
    self.seat_cap=seat_cap
  def Total_fare(self,seat_cap):
    Total_fare= self.seat_cap * 100
    return Total_fare
  def Bus(self,Total_fare):
    extra = (Total_fare * 10) /100
    final_amount = Total_fare + extra
    print(final_amount)


seat_cap = int(input("Enter the seat capacity"))
vehicle= input("Enter vehicle type")
lis=Vehicle()
Total_fare=lis.Total_fare(seat_cap)
if vehicle=="bus":
    lis.Bus(Total_fare)
else:
  print(Total_fare)
